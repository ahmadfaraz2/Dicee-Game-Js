## What I Learned
Through this project, I have learned:

1. **DOM Manipulation:** Understanding how to select, modify, and add elements to the DOM using JavaScript.
2. **Random Number Generation:** Using JavaScript to generate random numbers within a specified range.
3. **Dynamic Content Update:** How to update the content on the webpage dynamically based on user actions.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for the inspiration and guidance through her web development course.

The purpose of this is to Understand the DOM manipulation, how DOM works, how we can use JavaScript to change the behavior of our site.
